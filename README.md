<h2>Homework 1</h2>
<p>This project involves manipulating images in the frequency domain to reduce noise and improve clarity. Techniques such as Gaussian low-pass filtering are applied to reduce high-frequency noise, and noise reduction is performed by zeroing out specific frequency components. Sharpness evaluation is done using the Laplacian operator to identify the best-focused images from a set. The effectiveness of the filtering is visually compared by displaying original, frequency-transformed, and filtered images. The results demonstrate improvements in image quality through selective frequency adjustments.</p>

<h2>Homework 2</h2>
<p>This homework focuses on several image processing techniques, including reading and processing grayscale images, performing histogram equalization, and applying filters. Images are first converted to grayscale, then histogram equalization is applied to enhance contrast. Median filtering is used to reduce noise, followed by further equalization to optimize the visual quality of the image. The project also analyzes the histograms of multiple images to evaluate how the equalization affects different image regions. Each step is illustrated by comparing histograms and visualizing the processed images.</p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>This project implements a JPEG compression algorithm using MATLAB, allowing users to compress images by adjusting the quality factor. The process involves converting images to grayscale, performing discrete cosine transforms (DCT), and quantizing the DCT coefficients to reduce image size. The function calculates the compression ratio, showing how much the image size has been reduced after compression. The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created with MATLAB's App Designer, enabling users to upload images, adjust the compression quality, and view both the compressed image and the resulting compression ratio.</p>
